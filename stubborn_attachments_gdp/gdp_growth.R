# ####Notes
# The nation's gross domestic product totals trillions of dollars. Most often, the number youâ€™ll hear people refer to as "GDP" is a percentage. That's the rate of change in real GDP from the previous quarter or year. "Real" or "chained" GDP numbers have been adjusted to remove the effects of inflation over time, so different periods can be compared.
# 
# "Current-dollar" or "nominal" GDP estimates are based on market prices during the period being measured.
# 
# This table shows percent change in GDP dating back to 1930.
# 
# This table shows dollar amounts for GDP dating back to 1929.
